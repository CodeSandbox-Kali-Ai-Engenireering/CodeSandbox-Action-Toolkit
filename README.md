Creating an Action with the Toolkit
‚ùì Choosing an action type

Outlines the differences and why you would want to create a JavaScript or a container based action.


‚û∞ Versioning

Actions are downloaded and run from the GitHub graph of repos. This contains guidance for versioning actions and safe releases.


‚ö†Ô∏è Problem Matchers

Problem Matchers are a way to scan the output of actions for a specified regex pattern and surface that information prominently in the UI.


‚ö†Ô∏è Proxy Server Support

Self-hosted runners can be configured to run behind proxy servers.


Hello World JavaScript Action
Illustrates how to create a simple hello world javascript action.

...
  const nameToGreet = core.getInput('who-to-greet');
  console.log(`Hello ${nameToGreet}!`);
...

JavaScript Action Walkthrough
Walkthrough and template for creating a JavaScript Action with tests, linting, workflow, publishing, and versioning.

async function run() {
  try {
    const ms = core.getInput('milliseconds');
    console.log(`Waiting ${ms} milliseconds ...`)
    ...
PASS ./index.test.js
  ‚úì throws invalid number
  ‚úì wait 500 ms
  ‚úì test runs

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total

TypeScript Action Walkthrough
Walkthrough creating a TypeScript Action with compilation, tests, linting, workflow, publishing, and versioning.

import * as core from '@actions/core';

async function run() {
  try {
    const ms = core.getInput('milliseconds');
    console.log(`Waiting ${ms} milliseconds ...`)
    ...
PASS ./index.test.js
  ‚úì throws invalid number
  ‚úì wait 500 ms
  ‚úì test runs

Tests:       3 passed, 3 total


Docker Action Walkthrough
Create an action that is delivered as a container and run with docker.

FROM alpine:3.10
COPY LICENSE README.md /
COPY entrypoint.sh /entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/entrypoint.sh"]


Docker Action Walkthrough with Octokit
Create an action that is delivered as a container which uses the toolkit. This example uses the GitHub context to construct an Octokit client.

FROM node:slim
COPY . .
RUN npm install --production
ENTRYPOINT ["node", "/lib/main.js"]

const myInput = core.getInput('myInput');
core.debug(`Hello ${myInput} from inside a container`);

const context = github.context;
console.log(`We can even get context data, like the repo: ${context.repo.repo}`)
